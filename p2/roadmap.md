# Roadmap for Building a Code Editor

## **Introduction**

This roadmap outlines the steps to build a functional code editor inspired by modern editors like VSCode and Sublime Text. The focus is on creating a structured, efficient development process using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, integrating custom data structures where appropriate.

---

## **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**

### Goal: Establish the foundation of the application, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

- Define the folder structure for components, handlers, and core utilities.
- Create an HTML layout for the app, including the file explorer, tab bar, and editor pane.
- Implement base styling with CSS for the editor interface.
- Integrate custom data structures into the project to manage:
  - **RTArray**: For managing lines of code.
  - **RTQueue**: For command buffers (handling keyboard input).
  - **RTStack**: For undo/redo functionality.
- Establish a global service (singleton) to manage the application's state.

---

## **Phase 2: Input Handling**

### Goal: Enable text input functionality and basic editor behavior.

- Implement a mechanism to display editable lines using a `contenteditable` span or custom logic.
- Handle user input for typing characters, pressing "Enter" to create new lines.
- Add a dynamic cursor system to manage navigation within and between lines.
- Create a system to store and manage the current state of the document using RTArray.

---

## **Phase 3: Line Management**

### Goal: Ensure smooth interaction with lines of code in the editor.

- Dynamically update line numbers as lines are added or removed.
- Implement scrolling behavior to handle large files effectively.
- Optimize performance for rendering and managing multiple lines by only re-rendering changes.

---

## **Phase 4: File Explorer and Tab Management**

### Goal: Add functionality for managing files and switching between them.

- Create a file explorer that supports:
  - Displaying folder structures.
  - Creating, renaming, and deleting files and folders.
- Implement a tab system that allows users to open and switch between multiple files.
- Add the ability to save and load file contents using in-memory storage or `localStorage`.

---

## **Phase 5: Command Buffer and Undo/Redo**

### Goal: Enhance user interactions with undo/redo and command handling.

- Expand the command buffer logic using RTQueue to handle complex keyboard input sequences (e.g., shortcuts).
- Use RTStack to manage undo/redo operations for editing actions.
- Integrate global keyboard event listeners to process commands and shortcuts like `Ctrl+S`, `Ctrl+Z`, and `Ctrl+Y`.

---

## **Phase 6: Syntax Highlighting**

### Goal: Improve code readability by adding syntax highlighting.

- Implement a basic tokenizer using regular expressions to identify keywords, strings, and comments for supported languages (e.g., HTML, CSS, JS).
- Style tokens dynamically using CSS classes.
- Add support for switching themes (e.g., light and dark mode).

---

## **Phase 7: Advanced Editor Features**

### Goal: Add features that enhance the editing experience.

- Implement a search and replace system with support for regex.
- Add error indicators for syntax issues using basic validation logic.
- Introduce autosave functionality to save progress automatically.
- Make the layout resizable, allowing users to adjust the size of the file explorer, tabs, and editor panes.

---

## **Phase 8: Optimization and Optional Features**

### Goal: Polish the editor and add optional functionalities for a richer experience.

- Optimize rendering performance for large documents by implementing virtual scrolling.
- Introduce custom themes and allow users to personalize the editor's appearance.
- Add support for basic code formatting.
- If time permits, explore the feasibility of implementing real-time collaboration (basic multi-user editing).

---

## **Conclusion**

This roadmap provides a clear and logical progression of tasks to build your code editor efficiently. Focus on completing each phase before moving on to the next, and iterate on features as needed to refine the user experience.
